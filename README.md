## About
A website to show employers and recruiters projects I've done and am doing. It has various features like project filtering and an automatic table of contents. Its content is in markdown ([sample project page](https://github.com/GnoxNahte/portfolio-main/blob/main/src/content/projects/portfolio-website.mdx?plain=1)), making it easy to edit in the future. It's also quick to load and has nice animations.
