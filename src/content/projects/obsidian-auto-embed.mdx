## Background
I started using Obsidian and wanted to embed various websites into it. Since I couldn't find any plugins that does it, I made my own and published it. Currently, it has over a thousand downloads.

The rest of this is the same as the GitHub page. It shows what features are in the plugin and how to use it.

If you are curious on my process on building it, you can view the [development process](/obsidian-auto-embed-build-process/).

## Description
[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) plugin to help embed links automatically instead of using iframes
 
## Getting Started
Assuming you have [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) downloaded, 
Download the plugin: https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=auto-embed

### Embedding links
1. Paste a link
2. Select "Create Embed"
3. (Optional) Add [Options](#custom-options)
4. Done! Wait for the embed to load

Uses the same syntax as Obsidian - [Embed Web pages](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Embed+web+pages). Syntax: `![options](link)`

## Features
Auto embeds websites like: [Imgur](https://imgur.com/), [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/). Full list of [supported websites](#supported-websites)

### Supported websites:
- [X](https://x.com) *
- [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) *
- [Imgur](https://imgur.com/)
- [CodePen](https://codepen.io/)
- [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/)
- [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/) *

For a list with examples of how the websites look like [Supported Websites List](SupportedWebsiteList.md)

## Custom Options
How to add options: 
- In between the square brackets - `![add options here](https://example.com)`
- If you aren't sure which options are available, refer to the table below

### All options:
| Option | Description | Example Markdown |
|---|---|---|
|noembed|Disables embedding for this link. If possible, try using `[](link)` instead. Same syntax, just without '!'|`![noembed](https://example.com)`
|w:`value` / width:`value`|Sets embed's width|`![w:100%](https://example.com)`
|h:`value` / height:`value`|Sets embed's height |`![h:500px](https://example.com)`

Uses [CSS Units](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Values_and_units#lengths) where applicable.

## Custom styles
TODO: Add a table that lists all the CSS classes users can override.


## How the plugin works
A brief overview with some steps on how the plugin works. *Not required to use the plugin*, just for those who are curious. Certain steps vary depending on whether you're in **Reading View** or **Live Preview**. However, the plugin doesn't have any impact when you're in source mode.
1. Search where in the document the syntax is found.
	- In **Reading View**: 
		Searches for the `<img>` tag that's generated by Obsidian when you use this format: `![](link)`
	- In **Live Preview**: 
		Searches for `![](link)` and gets the [options](#custom-options) and URL from it.
2. Get the URL from it, and convert it to the embed equivalent. Usually adds `/embed/` somewhere in the url. Results in the same website but focused only on the content. No headers, footer, etc
	- Example: https://codepen.io/jh3y/pen/LYNZwGm converts to https://codepen.io/jh3y/embed/LYNZwGm?default-tab=result&editable=true
3. Replace those tags with `<iframe>` and apply options (width, height, dark mode, etc)
4. Some websites like Twitter, Reddit or Imgur, will send a resize message. The plugin uses the info to resize the embed.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Add support for other websites (If you want other websites, create an issue or message me)
	- [ ] Google Maps
	- [ ] Google Docs
	- [ ] Google Calendar
	- [ ] Notion 
	- [ ] Other websites. [Iframely](https://iframely.com/domains) has a list of websites that can be embedded.
- [ ] Add tests
- [ ] Updated README.md
	- [ ] Improve readability. Open to suggestions, especially if something isn't clear.
	- [ ]  Add images/gifs to show examples
 	- [ ]  Add installation instructions

### Current Limitations & Known Bugs 
#### General
- **Live Preview**: It's still experimental which means it might have bugs. 
- **Mobile**: Not tested yet
#### Website specific
- **Reddit**: Incorrect resizing of Reddit embeds when multiple Reddit embeds appear in the same view.
    - Space out Reddit embeds such that there aren't multiple embeds in your view
    - Manually set the height by using options: `![h:240px](Reddit link)`
- **Spotify**: Only able to play 30 seconds of a song. Spotify only allows when the user is logged in to the browser, which isn't possible in Obsidian. 
- **Twitter & YouTube**: Since [Obsidian supports it](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Embed+web+pages), I won't interfere with it. However, it means [options](#custom-options) isn't supported. I might be able to replace Obsidian's embeds with mine, but [options](#custom-options) will only work in *Live Preview*, but not *Reading Mode*. This makes an inconsistent user experience but if you want this feature, contact me / create a pull request.
- **Twitter / X**: Obsidian supports https://twitter.com but not https://x.com. This plugin just helps to embed X. If you replace Twitter with x, or vice versa, it'll lead to the same tweet/post. Usually when copying from the mobile app, it's X. When copying from the web, it's Twitter.
