## Game Overview
- Main gameplay: Enemies spawn around the player, and the player has to defeat them using their attacks and abilities. 
- Unique Selling Point: The player shoots out dices (following the game jam theme), and depending on what side of the dice is facing up, the player will activate the ability on that face.
- Inspired by [Vampire Survivors](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/).
- This game was for [GMTK Game Jam 2022](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-jam-2022), theme is "Roll of the Dice".

## Main Features that I did
- Attacks 
    - Basic Attack - The player shoots dice, and depending on which face of the dice is up, the dice spawns an ability that attacks / gives a status effect to the enemies.
    - Abilities: 
        - Fire - Creates an explosion, damaging nearby enemies
        - Ice - Shoots ice spears at enemies, piercing enemies
        - Poison - Spawns a pool of poison, poisoning enemies inside.
        - Lightning - Strikes down random enemies, dealing area damage to those nearby.
        - Gravity - Creates a black hole, pulling enemies near the center
        - Magic Circle - Slows enemies and increase player attack speed
    - Made a system that allows me to easily add new abilities and control the cooldown, time, damage, push-back force & radius for the abilities. I'm also able to add custom effects like giving increased attack speed when in magic circle.
    - Players can upgrade the abilities, increasing the abilities effect.
    - Also did the UI for selecting abilities and assigning abilities to the dice faces.
