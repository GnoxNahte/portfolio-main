## Introduction
Slowly rebuilding my portfolio website. My [old website](https://gnoxnahte.com) for comparison. 

## Reasons
Why I want to rebuild the website:
- It was my first serious website, which resulted in messy code.
- Don't really like the styles of it, especially the dull colors.
- Want to separate between [web dev](https://webdev.gnoxnahte.dev/) and [game dev](https://gamedev.gnoxnahte.dev/). Maybe have different themes for each site? Thinking of web dev being a modern website and game dev be a website with some gaming elements added. Something like: https://bruno-simon.com/
