## Background
Slowly rebuilding this website. If you are curious, here's my [building and thought process](../portfolio-website-build-process). 

<details>
<summary> Reasons for rebuilding it </summary>
Why I want to rebuild the website:
- It was my first serious website, which resulted in messy code.
- Don't really like the styles of it, especially the dull colors.
- Have Dark and light mode. Explained and shown more here: [Theme Switching](#theme-switching)
- (Still WIP) Want to separate between [web dev](https://webdev.gnoxnahte.dev/) and [game dev](https://gamedev.gnoxnahte.dev/). Maybe have different themes for each site? Thinking of web dev being a modern website and game dev be a website with some gaming elements added. Something like: https://bruno-simon.com/
</details>

## Main Features
### Theme switching
Has nice transitions between the 2 themes, without any sudden colors changes.  Note that light theme is still WIP.

Click on the **Sun/Moon icon on the top right** to try it!

### Project filtering

### Easy to add projects
Uses markdown, making adding new projects very easy. No need to write full pages in HTML and CSS for every project!
Mainly thanks to [Astro's Markdown and Content Collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/).

### Fast to load
Uses [Unlighthouse](https://next.unlighthouse.dev/) which uses [Google's Lighthouse](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse) to scan the **entire** website.

### Smooth animations
As shown in the [Theme Switching](#theme-switching) and [Project Filtering](#project-filtering) sections.
