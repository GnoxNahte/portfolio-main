## Introduction
This is a basic portfolio website made for fun and experimenting. It's my first website that I built from scratch and publishing to the web so please give me any feedback that you have. 

I'm also slowly rebuilding the website - https://gnoxnahte.dev. The main reasons are because since this is my first serious websites, some code isn't easily maintainable to add new features and fix bugs. I also don't really the bland colors and would like to change the styles. Hoping to separate "web dev" and "game dev" too.

## Why I chose to build a website from scratch
- Learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript / TypeScript
- More flexibility and control
- Search functionality, making it easier for potential clients / employers to find projects related to the work they are doing
- Better performance (Especially when compared to website builders)
- My [previous website](https://ethanong-jh.wixsite.com/portfolio) for reference (Using Wix)

## Why I chose [Astro](https://astro.build/)
- Easy to start, for a beginner in web development
- Has great markdown features, making it easy to create new project pages and update the site. Like a blog
- Fast and responsive with its islands architecture and server-side rendering 
- Pre-renders most of the JavaScript on the server, making it easy to build and fast when clients view it. 
- Free
- Open source 
- Active community 
- Frequent updates

## Things to improve
- UI & UX
    - I'm mainly a programmer with very less knowledge on website UI design.
    - Please give feedback on how to improve the website. It would be much appreciated. 
    - Some general UI & UX improvements todo:
        - Colors - Using some general dark mode colors for now, could definitely be improved and give the website more life. Also can make the website clearer.
        - Accessibility - Labeling buttons, link / anchor tags, etc for accessibility.
        - Readability - Some parts are lengthy, hard to read. I've tried to my best to divide it into short bullet points but it can definitely be improved further. 
- SEO
    - Adding tags for sharing on different social media websites.
- Performance
    - Though Astro is very fast, there are still things that can can be improved
