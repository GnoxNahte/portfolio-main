## Background
NOTE: Putting this here because it's my first client project, even though its a bit simple.

Before polytechnic, I self-learnt some [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) and was offered to freelance a bingo game for a MapleStory event. It was offered by my father who was an designer there. I struggled quite a bit as it was my first client project with only basic programming knowledge. I was able to release it to the iPad using [Testflight](https://developer.apple.com/testflight/) and shared it to them. Sadly, I have lost the source code and the build.

A few years later, after I graduated from polytechnic, they offered to make another bingo minigame, with updated assets. I accepted and this was the game. With stronger programming knowledge, I was able to make a build in 2 days and uploaded it to itch.io where they can easily play.

Here's the version with new build:
<ItchGameEmbed itchLink="https://html-classic.itch.zone/html/6266976/WebGL_Build/index.html" projectName="Awaken the Chaos"/>

You can try on Itch.io too.

## Features
It's a simple game which does:
1. A button, which when clicked
2. Cycle through characters that haven't been chosen
3. Set the chosen character to the grid
4. Repeat until the board is filled
