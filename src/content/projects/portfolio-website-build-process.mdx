## Introduction
If you want to see the features the website has, there's [another blog](../projects/portfolio-website/) for it. This is just showing the building process, showing my thought process.

### Why I chose to build a website from scratch
- Learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript / TypeScript
- More flexibility and control
- Search functionality, making it easier for potential clients / employers to find projects related to the work they are doing
- Better performance (Especially when compared to website builders)
- My [previous website](https://ethanong-jh.wixsite.com/portfolio) for reference (Using Wix)

### Why I chose [Astro](https://astro.build/)
- Easy to start, for a beginner in web development
- Has great markdown features, making it easy to create new project pages and update the site. Like a blog
- Fast and responsive with its islands architecture and server-side rendering 
- Pre-renders most of the JavaScript on the server, making it easy to build and fast when clients view it. 
- Free
- Open source 
- Active community 
- Frequent updates

## Challenges faced
### Designing the website
As someone who isn't a designer, I spent a lot of time self-studying various topics and referencing (more than the usual UI/UX designer) good and bad design decisions on other websites. This website is all of my design knowledge I've learnt.

#### Choosing *Colors*
My last website was very dull, with grey as it's main color. For this website, I had to learn about Color Theory and had to make . As someone who has very little experience in art, it was all new for me. I still think the current colors can be improved, but I'm satisfied for now.

## Things to improve
### Better support for accessibility
Currently, many elements don't follow user's preference, for example, if a user has the [*reduced-motion*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-reduced-motion) preference turned on, the website doesn't won't adhere to them.

I could just do this. It reduces all animation duration to 0, reducing ALL motion. But I feel like it's a bit too much as [some animation is good](https://css-tricks.com/introduction-reduced-motion-media-query/#aa-so-should-i-get-just-play-it-safe-and-get-rid-of-all-my-animation) 
```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
* {
    animation-duration: 0s !important;
    transition-duration: 0s !important;
}
```

### Support more devices
Haven't tested it on many devices yet, especially mobile.

### Light theme
Was focusing on dark mode, haven't tried many light mode colors. Need to make sure it works on all pages too.

### More consistent styles
Currently parts of the website have slihgly different styling. For example, some parts of the website have hardcoded colors or hardcoded px/em sizes. 
I've seen some sites use [CSS variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) to have more consistent styling. Here are some examples.

For colors:
```css
:root {
    /* This is already in the project */
    --color-background: #1f2247;
    --color-background-secondary: #131325;
    --color-primary: #d86372;

    /* More colors to add? */
    --color-border: #000;
    --color-border-subtle: #222;
}
```
For sizing
```css
:root {
    --size-xs: 4px;
    --size-s: 8px;
    --size-m: 12px;
    --size-l: 16px;
    --size-xl: 24px;
}
```
