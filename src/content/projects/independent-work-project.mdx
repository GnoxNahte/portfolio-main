## Introduction
We were tasked with making a game from scratch using any engine we liked in 6 months.

Some of the main features in this project:
- Infinite procedural terrain generation
- 2 Player classes (Warrior and Archer) with basic levelling systems
- 2 Player Multiplayer Co-op 
- Zombie AI

## Terrain

Features: 
- Infinite terrain generation (As much as the user's memory allows)
- Uses [Compute Shaders](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-ComputeShader.html)
- Main method of generation: Layering different types 

This [article by Red Blob Games](https://www.redblobgames.com/maps/terrain-from-noise/#noise) helped a lot.
